neatly decapitated the boss
used the good old Antman-Thanos maneuver
recited the true name of the boss to weaken it
overwhelmed the enemy with sheer force of will
showed off lightning-fast reflexes to evade all attacks
exploited a little-known weakness
moonwalked up to the boss
rained blow upon blow upon the enemy
waited for someone else to take aggro
decided standing in the fire is not a good idea
